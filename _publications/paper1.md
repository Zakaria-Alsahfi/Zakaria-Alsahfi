## Abstract
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It spread very quickly from Hubei to the rest of China within only 30 days [1]. As of February 14, 2020, 78.91% of the total confirmed cases in China were in Hubei province which is in midland China and 60.33% of the total confirmed cases in Hubei were in Wuhan [2]. In this project we use K-Means clustering and regression analysis to classify the cities in China based on location and infection rate. The goal is analyzing the demographic and geographic characteristics of the clusters containing less than 5 members with high infection rate. We found that all the cities in the small groups with high infection rate are from Hubei province. We conclude that based on K-Means clustering and regression analysis, midland China is in trouble.
