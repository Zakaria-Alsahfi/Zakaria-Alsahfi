excerpt: "Photo sharing and photo storage services like to have location data for each photo that is uploaded. With the location data, these services can build advanced features, such as automatic suggestion of relevant tags or automatic photo organization, which help provide a compelling user experience. Although a photo's location can often be obtained by looking at the photo's metadata, many photos uploaded to these services will not have location metadata available. This can happen when, for example, the camera capturing the picture does not have GPS or if a photo's metadata is scrubbed due to privacy concerns. 
    If no location metadata for an image is available, one way to infer the location is to detect and classify a discernible landmark in the image. Given the large number of landmarks across the world and the immense volume of images that are uploaded to photo sharing services, using human judgement to classify these landmarks would not be feasible.
    In this project, we will take the first steps towards addressing this problem by building models to automatically predict the location of the image based on any landmarks depicted in the image. At the end of this project, our code will accept any user-supplied image as input and suggest the top k most relevant landmarks from 50 possible landmarks from across the world. "

## Step 1: Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (from Scratch)

### Specify Data Loaders for the Landmark Dataset

###### Specify appropriate transforms
```python
# # convert data to a normalized torch.FloatTensor
image_transforms = transforms.Compose([transforms.Resize(size=224),
                                       transforms.CenterCrop(size=224),
                                       transforms.RandomRotation(20),
                                       transforms.ToTensor(),
                                       transforms.Normalize([0.485, 0.456, 0.406],
                                                            [0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
                                      ])

```

###### Write data loaders for training, validation, and test sets
```python
train_data = datasets.ImageFolder(traindir, transform=image_transforms)
test_data = datasets.ImageFolder(testdir, transform=image_transforms)
```

```python
loaders_scratch = {'train': torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size,
                                                        sampler=train_sampler, num_workers=num_workers,
                                                       pin_memory=True),
                   'valid': torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_data, batch_size=batch_size, 
                                                        sampler=train_sampler, num_workers=num_workers,
                                                       pin_memory=True),
                   'test': torch.utils.data.DataLoader(test_data, batch_size=batch_size, 
                                                       num_workers=num_workers, pin_memory=True)}

# prepare data loaders (combine dataset and sampler)
train_loader = loaders_scratch['train']
valid_loader = loaders_scratch['valid']
test_loader = loaders_scratch['test']

num_classes = len(train_data.classes)
print(num_classes)
```

I resized all image to 224 pixel, center cropped, add randomly rotations for some degrees to avoid overfitting of the model.

I tried to approached the problem iteratively and starting with the examples from this project, I am working with (224, 224, 3) images, so the inputs are significantly bigger than the labs (28, 28, 1) for Mnist and (32x32x3) for CIFAR.
I've also realized that the most of the pre-trained models require the input to be 224x224 pixel images. Also, I'll need to match the normalization used when the models were trained. Each color channel has to normalized separately, the means are [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and the standard deviations are [0.229, 0.224, 0.225].

### Visualize a Batch of Training Data

Visualizing the output of our data loader.

### Specify Loss Function and Optimizer

```python
## TODO: select loss function
criterion_scratch = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

def get_optimizer_scratch(model):
    ## TODO: select and return an optimizer
    model = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    
    return model
```

### Model Architecture

Create a CNN to classify images of landmarks.


    create model ... Net(
      (conv1): Conv2d(3, 16, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
      (conv2): Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
      (conv3): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
      (pool): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=2, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
      (fc1): Linear(in_features=50176, out_features=128, bias=True)
      (fc2): Linear(in_features=128, out_features=50, bias=True)
      (dropout): Dropout(p=0.25, inplace=False)
      (batch_norm): BatchNorm1d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
    )


The first layer in the CNN is a convolutional layer that takes (224, 224, 3) input size of 50 classes.

I'd like the new layer to have 16 filters, each with a height and width of 3. When performing the convolution, I'd like the filter to jump 1 pixel at a time.

    _nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernelsize, stride=1, padding=0)

I want this layer to have the same width and height as the input layer, so I will pad accordingly; Then, to construct this convolutional layer, I use the following line of code:

    self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(3, 32, 3, padding=1)

I am adding a pool layer that takes a kernel_size and a stride after every convolution layer. This will down-sample the input's x-y dimensions, by a factor of 2:

    self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2,2)

I am adding a fully connected linear layer at the end to produce a 50-dim output. As well as a Dropout layer to avoid overfitting.

A forward pass would give the following structure:

    torch.Size([16, 3, 224, 224])

    torch.Size([16, 16, 112, 112])

    torch.Size([16, 32, 56, 56])

    torch.Size([16, 64, 28, 28])

    torch.Size([16, 50176])

    torch.Size([16, 500])

    torch.Size([16, 50])


### Experiment with the Weight Initialization

        m.bias.data.zero_()
    elif isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
        m.weight.data.normal_(0, 0.02)
        m.bias.data.zero_()
    
model_scratch.apply(custom_weight_init)
model_scratch = train(10, loaders_scratch, model_scratch, get_optimizer_scratch(model_scratch),

## Step 2: Create a CNN to Classify Landmarks (using Transfer Learning)

We will now use transfer learning to create a CNN that can identify landmarks from images.

### Specify Data Loaders for the Landmark Dataset

```python
### TODO: Write data loaders for training, validation, and test sets
## Specify appropriate transforms, and batch_sizes

loaders_transfer = loaders_scratch.copy()
# prepare data loaders (combine dataset and sampler)
train_loader = loaders_transfer['train']
valid_loader = loaders_transfer['valid']
test_loader = loaders_transfer['test']
```

### Specify Loss Function and Optimizer


```python
## TODO: select loss function
criterion_transfer = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

def get_optimizer_transfer(model):
    ## TODO: select and return optimizer
    model = optim.AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
    return model
```

### Model Architecture

Use transfer learning to create a CNN to classify images of landmarks.


```python
## TODO: Specify model architecture
model_transfer =  models.alexnet(pretrained=True)
```

    AlexNet(
      (features): Sequential(
        (0): Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=(11, 11), stride=(4, 4), padding=(2, 2))
        (1): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (2): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
        (3): Conv2d(64, 192, kernel_size=(5, 5), stride=(1, 1), padding=(2, 2))
        (4): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (5): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
        (6): Conv2d(192, 384, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
        (7): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (8): Conv2d(384, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
        (9): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (10): Conv2d(256, 256, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=(1, 1), padding=(1, 1))
        (11): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (12): MaxPool2d(kernel_size=3, stride=2, padding=0, dilation=1, ceil_mode=False)
      )
      (avgpool): AdaptiveAvgPool2d(output_size=(6, 6))
      (classifier): Sequential(
        (0): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)
        (1): Linear(in_features=9216, out_features=4096, bias=True)
        (2): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (3): Dropout(p=0.5, inplace=False)
        (4): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=4096, bias=True)
        (5): ReLU(inplace=True)
        (6): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=50, bias=True)
      )
    )
 

I'll use a **alexnet** model from torchvision model archiv, which was already trained previously. The classifier part of the model is a single fully-connected layer:

        classifier[6]: (6): Linear(in_features=4096, out_features=1000, bias=True)

This layer was already trained on the ImageNet dataset, so it won't work for the landmark classification specific problem with different output size, means I need to replace the classifier (50 classes).

### Train and Validate the Model

Train and validate our model and Save the final model parameters.  

```python
model_transfer.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_transfer.pt'))
```

    load previous saved model ...

    Epoch: 7 	Training Loss: 2.470517 	Validation Loss: 0.780295
    Validation loss decreased (0.908761 --> 0.780295).  Saving model ...

<a id='step3'></a>

## Step 3: Write Your Landmark Prediction Algorithm

Implement the function `predict_landmarks`, which accepts a file path to an image and an integer k, and then predicts the **top k most likely landmarks**.


```python
def predict_landmarks(img_path, k):
    ## TODO: return the names of the top k landmarks predicted by the transfer learned CNN
    real_class = img_path.split('/')[-2]
    img_pil = Image.open( img_path ).convert('RGB')
    img_tensor = image_transforms( img_pil )[:3,:,:].unsqueeze(0)

    # move model inputs to cuda, if GPU available
    # Resize
    if use_cuda:
        img_tensor = img_tensor.view(1, 3, 224, 224).cuda()
    else:
        img_tensor = img_tensor.view(1, 3, 224, 224)
    
    # Set to evaluation
    with torch.no_grad():
        model_transfer.eval
        # Model outputs log probabilities
        out = model_transfer(img_tensor)
        ps = torch.exp(out)

        # Find the topk predictions
        topk, topclass = ps.topk(k, dim=1)

        # Extract the actual classes
        top_classes = [
            train_data.classes[class_] for class_ in topclass.cpu().numpy()[0]
        ]
        
        top_p = topk.cpu().numpy()[0]

        return top_classes
```

Implement the function `suggest_locations`, which accepts a file path to an image as input, and then displays the image and the **top 3 most likely landmarks** as predicted by `predict_landmarks`.


```python
def suggest_locations(img_path):
    # get landmark predictions
    predicted_landmarks = predict_landmarks(img_path, 3)
    
    ## TODO: display image and display landmark predictions
    img_pil = Image.open( img_path ).convert('RGB')
    img_tensor = image_transforms( img_pil )[:3,:,:].unsqueeze(0)
    plt.figure(figsize=(9, 3))
    ax = plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    ax.imshow(img_pil)
    plt.show()
    pred = [str(i) for i in predicted_landmarks]
    print('Is this pictuer of the\n'+ ", ".join(pred))
```

### Test our Algorithm

Test our algorithm by running the `suggest_locations` function on our images.
