In this project we will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. We will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, We will deploy our model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.

## General Outline

Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.

* [Step 1](#step1): Download or otherwise retrieve the data.
* [Step 2](#step2): Process / Prepare the data.
* [Step 3](#step3): Upload the processed data to S3.
* [Step 4](#step4): Train a chosen model.
* [Step 5](#step5): Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).
* [Step 6](#step6): Deploy the trained model.
* [Step 7](#step7): Use the deployed model.

For this project, we will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications. 

First, we will not be testing the model in its own step. We will still be testing the model, however, we will do it by deploying our model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that we can make sure that our deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.

In addition, we will deploy and use our trained model a second time. In the second iteration we will customize the way that our trained model is deployed by including some of our own code. In addition, our newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.

## Step 1: Downloading the data
As in the XGBoost in SageMaker notebook, we will be using the [IMDb dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)


```python
%mkdir ../data
!wget -O ../data/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz
!tar -zxf ../data/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz -C ../data
```
<a id='step2'></a>

## Step 2: Preparing and Processing the data

Also, as in the XGBoost notebook, we will be doing some initial data processing. To begin with, we will read in each of the reviews and combine them into a single input structure. Then, we will split the dataset into a training set and a testing set.

```python
data, labels = read_imdb_data()
print("IMDB reviews: train = {} pos / {} neg, test = {} pos / {} neg".format(
            len(data['train']['pos']), len(data['train']['neg']),
            len(data['test']['pos']), len(data['test']['neg'])))
```

    IMDB reviews: train = 12500 pos / 12500 neg, test = 12500 pos / 12500 neg


Now that we've read the raw training and testing data from the downloaded dataset, we will combine the positive and negative reviews and shuffle the resulting records.

```python
train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = prepare_imdb_data(data, labels)
print("IMDb reviews (combined): train = {}, test = {}".format(len(train_X), len(test_X)))
```

    IMDb reviews (combined): train = 25000, test = 25000


Now that we have our training and testing sets unified and prepared, we should do a quick check and see an example of the data our model will be trained on. This is generally a good idea as it allows us to see how each of the further processing steps affects the reviews and it also ensures that the data has been loaded correctly.


```python
print(train_X[100])
print(train_y[100])
```

    One of Frances Farmer's earliest movies; at 22, she is absolutely beautiful. Bing Crosby is in great voice, but the songs are not his best. Martha Raye and Bob Burns are interesting, but their comedy, probably great in its time, is really corny today. Roy Rogers also appears- in a singing role. In my view only worth watching if you are a Frances Farmer fan, and possibly a Bing Crosby fan.

The first step in processing the reviews is to make sure that any html tags that appear should be removed. In addition we wish to tokenize our input, that way words such as *entertained* and *entertaining* are considered the same with regard to sentiment analysis.

The `review_to_words` method defined above uses `BeautifulSoup` to remove any html tags that appear and uses the `nltk` package to tokenize the reviews. Also, this method convert to lower letters, split string into words, remove stopwords and stem the words, remove punctuation marks. 

```python
# TODO: Apply review_to_words to a review (train_X[100] or any other review)
review_to_words(train_X[100])
```

    ['one',
     'franc',
     'farmer',
     'earliest',
     'movi',
     '22',
     'absolut',
     'beauti',
     'bing',
     'crosbi',
     'great',
     'voic',
     'song',
     'best',
     'martha',
     'ray',
     'bob',
     'burn',
     'interest',
     'comedi',
     'probabl',
     'great',
     'time',
     'realli',
     'corni',
     'today',
     'roy',
     'roger',
     'also',
     'appear',
     'sing',
     'role',
     'view',
     'worth',
     'watch',
     'franc',
     'farmer',
     'fan',
     'possibl',
     'bing',
     'crosbi',
     'fan']




The method below applies the `review_to_words` method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if we are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, we can come back without needing to process the data a second time.

```python
# Preprocess data
train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y = preprocess_data(train_X, test_X, train_y, test_y)
```

    Wrote preprocessed data to cache file: preprocessed_data.pkl


## Transform the data

In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as `1`.

Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label `0`) and truncate long reviews.

### Create a word dictionary

To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be `5000` but we may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.

```python
# determine the five most frequently appearing words in the training set.
word_dict = build_dict(train_X)
list(word_dict.keys())[0:5]
```

    ['movi', 'film', 'one', 'like', 'time']



### Save `word_dict`

Later on when we construct an endpoint which processes a submitted review we will need to make use of the `word_dict` which we have created. As such, we will save it to a file now for future use.


```python
data_dir = '../data/pytorch' # The folder we will use for storing data
if not os.path.exists(data_dir): # Make sure that the folder exists
    os.makedirs(data_dir)
```


```python
with open(os.path.join(data_dir, 'word_dict.pkl'), "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(word_dict, f)
```

### Transform the reviews

Now that we have our word dictionary which allows us to transform the words appearing in the reviews into integers, it is time to make use of it and convert our reviews to their integer sequence representation, making sure to pad or truncate to a fixed length, which in our case is `500`.


```python
train_X, train_X_len = convert_and_pad_data(word_dict, train_X)
test_X, test_X_len = convert_and_pad_data(word_dict, test_X)
```

As a quick check to make sure that things are working as intended, check to see what one of the reviews in the training set looks like after having been processeed. Does this look reasonable? What is the length of a review in the training set?


```python
# examine one of the processed reviews to make sure everything is working as intended.
print(train_X[100])
print('Length of train_X[100]: {}'.format(len(train_X[100])))

```

`preprocess_data` function processed the raw data into something that is usable to the machine learning algorithm. It applies the `review_to_words` method to each of the reviews in training and testing dataset. So, it is necessary to avoid longer processing time when restarting the notebook. `convert_and_pad_data` function transformed the words appearing in the reviews into integer sequence representation. All the reviews are truncated to a fixed length, which is 500. Since LSTM classifier is used as the training algorithm, it is necessary to maintain a constant batch size during the training.

<a id='step3'></a>

## Step 3: Upload the data to S3

As in the XGBoost notebook, we will need to upload the training dataset to S3 in order for our training code to access it. For now we will save it locally and we will upload to S3 later on.

### Save the processed training dataset locally

It is important to note the format of the data that we are saving as we will need to know it when we write the training code. In our case, each row of the dataset has the form `label`, `length`, `review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers representing the words in the review.


```python
import pandas as pd
    
pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(train_y), pd.DataFrame(train_X_len), 
           pd.DataFrame(train_X)], 
          axis=1).to_csv(os.path.join(data_dir,'train.csv'), 
                         header=False, index=False)
```

### Uploading the training data

Next, we need to upload the training data to the SageMaker default S3 bucket so that we can provide access to it while training our model.


```python
input_data = sagemaker_session.upload_data(path=data_dir, bucket=bucket, 
                                           key_prefix=prefix)
```

The cell above uploads the entire contents of our data directory. This includes the `word_dict.pkl` file. This is fortunate as we will need this later on when we create an endpoint that accepts an arbitrary review. For now, we will just take note of the fact that it resides in the data directory (and so also in the S3 training bucket) and that we will need to make sure it gets saved in the model directory.

<a id='step4'></a>

## Step 4: Build and Train the PyTorch Model

In the XGBoost notebook we discussed what a model is in the SageMaker framework. In particular, a model comprises three objects

 - Model Artifacts,
 - Training Code, and
 - Inference Code,
 
each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.

We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script. For the purposes of this project we have provided the necessary model object in the `model.py` file, inside of the `train` folder. You can see the provided implementation by running the cell below.


```python
!pygmentize train/model.py

The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.

First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.


```python
# Read in only the first 250 rows
train_sample = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(data_dir, 'train.csv'), 
                           header=None, names=None, nrows=250)

# Turn the input pandas dataframe into tensors
train_sample_y = torch.from_numpy(train_sample[[0]].values).float().squeeze()
train_sample_X = torch.from_numpy(train_sample.drop([0], axis=1).values).long()

# Build the dataset
train_sample_ds = torch.utils.data.TensorDataset(train_sample_X, train_sample_y)
# Build the dataloader
train_sample_dl = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_sample_ds, batch_size=50)
```

### Writing the training method

Next we need to write the training code itself. 

```python
def train(model, train_loader, epochs, optimizer, loss_fn, device):
    for epoch in range(1, epochs + 1):
        model.train()
        total_loss = 0
        for batch in train_loader:         
            batch_X, batch_y = batch
            
            batch_X = batch_X.to(device)
            batch_y = batch_y.to(device)
            
            # TODO: Complete this train method to train the model provided.
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            out = model(batch_X)
            loss = loss_fn(out, batch_y)
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            total_loss += loss.data.item()
        print("Epoch: {}, BCELoss: {}".format(epoch, total_loss / len(train_loader)))
```

Supposing we have the training method above, we will test that it is working by writing a bit of code in the notebook that executes our training method on the small sample training set that we loaded earlier. The reason for doing this in the notebook is so that we have an opportunity to fix any errors that arise early when they are easier to diagnose.


```python
import torch.optim as optim
from train.model import LSTMClassifier

device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
model = LSTMClassifier(32, 100, 5000).to(device)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
loss_fn = torch.nn.BCELoss()

train(model, train_sample_dl, 5, optimizer, loss_fn, device)
```

    Epoch: 1, BCELoss: 0.6928366303443909
    Epoch: 2, BCELoss: 0.6814738273620605
    Epoch: 3, BCELoss: 0.6727345705032348
    Epoch: 4, BCELoss: 0.6641580820083618
    Epoch: 5, BCELoss: 0.6548731803894043


In order to construct a PyTorch model using SageMaker we must provide SageMaker with a training script. We may optionally include a directory which will be copied to the container and from which our training code will be run. When the training container is executed it will check the uploaded directory (if there is one) for a `requirements.txt` file and install any required Python libraries, after which the training script will be run.

### Training the model

```python
from sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorch

estimator = PyTorch(entry_point="train.py",
                    source_dir="train",
                    role=role,
                    framework_version='0.4.0',
                    train_instance_count=1,
                    train_instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge',
                    hyperparameters={
                        'epochs': 10,
                        'hidden_dim': 200,
                    })
```

```python
estimator.fit({'training': input_data})
```

    'create_image_uri' will be deprecated in favor of 'ImageURIProvider' class in SageMaker Python SDK v2.
    's3_input' class will be renamed to 'TrainingInput' in SageMaker Python SDK v2.

## Step 5: Testing the model

As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.

<a id='step6'></a>

## Step 6: Deploy the model for testing

Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form `review_length, review[500]` where `review[500]` is a sequence of `500` integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using `word_dict`. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.

There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called `model_fn()` and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.

Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.

```python
# TODO: Deploy the trained model
predictor = estimator.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge')
```
    -------------!

<a id='step7'></a>

## Step 7 - Use the model for testing

Once deployed, we can read in the test data and send it off to our deployed model to get some results. Once we collect all of the results we can determine how accurate our model is.


```python
test_X = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(test_X_len), pd.DataFrame(test_X)], axis=1)
```


```python
# We split the data into chunks and send each chunk seperately, accumulating the results.

def predict(data, rows=512):
    split_array = np.array_split(data, int(data.shape[0] / float(rows) + 1))
    predictions = np.array([])
    for array in split_array:
        predictions = np.append(predictions, predictor.predict(array))
    
    return predictions
```


```python
predictions = predict(test_X.values)
predictions = [round(num) for num in predictions]
```


```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy_score(test_y, predictions)
```




    0.82096



### More testing

We now have a trained model which has been deployed and which we can send processed reviews to and which returns the predicted sentiment. However, ultimately we would like to be able to send our model an unprocessed review. That is, we would like to send the review itself as a string. For example, suppose we wish to send the following review to our model.


```python
test_review = 'The simplest pleasures in life are the best, and this film is one of them. Combining a rather basic storyline of love and adventure this movie transcends the usual weekend fair with wit and unmitigated charm.'
```

The question we now need to answer is, how do we send this review to our model?

Recall in the first section of this notebook we did a bunch of data processing to the IMDb dataset. In particular, we did two specific things to the provided reviews.
 - Removed any html tags and stemmed the input
 - Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using `word_dict`
 
In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.

Using the `review_to_words` and `convert_and_pad` methods from section one, convert `test_review` into a numpy array `test_data` suitable to send to our model. Remember that our model expects input of the form `review_length, review[500]`.


```python
# Convert test_review into a form usable by the model and save the results in test_data

test_review_words = review_to_words(test_review)     # splits reviews to words
review_X, review_len = convert_and_pad(word_dict, test_review_words)   # pad review

data_pack = np.hstack((review_len, review_X))
data_pack = data_pack.reshape(1, -1)

test_data = torch.from_numpy(data_pack)
test_data = test_data.to(device)
```

Now that we have processed the review, we can send the resulting array to our model to predict the sentiment of the review.


```python
predictor.predict(test_data)
```


    array(0.8274373, dtype=float32)



Since the return value of our model is close to `1`, we can be certain that the review we submitted is positive.

### Delete the endpoint

Of course, just like in the XGBoost notebook, once we've deployed an endpoint it continues to run until we tell it to shut down. Since we are done using our endpoint for now, we can delete it.


```python
estimator.delete_endpoint()
```

    estimator.delete_endpoint() will be deprecated in SageMaker Python SDK v2. Please use the delete_endpoint() function on your predictor instead.

<a id='step6'></a>

## Step 6 (again) - Deploy the model for the web app

Now that we know that our model is working, it's time to create some custom inference code so that we can send the model a review which has not been processed and have it determine the sentiment of the review.

As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.

We will store the code that we write in the `serve` directory. Provided in this directory is the `model.py` file that we used to construct our model, a `utils.py` file which contains the `review_to_words` and `convert_and_pad` pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and `predict.py`, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that `requirements.txt` is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.

When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.
 - `model_fn`: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.
 - `input_fn`: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.
 - `output_fn`: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.
 - `predict_fn`: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.

For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the `input_fn` and `output_fn` methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.

### Writing inference code

Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.

As mentioned earlier, the `model_fn` method is the same as the one provided in the training code and the `input_fn` and `output_fn` methods are very simple and your task will be to complete the `predict_fn` method. 

### Deploying the model

Now that the custom inference code has been written, we will create and deploy our model. To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.

```python
from sagemaker.predictor import RealTimePredictor
from sagemaker.pytorch import PyTorchModel

class StringPredictor(RealTimePredictor):
    def __init__(self, endpoint_name, sagemaker_session):
        super(StringPredictor, self).__init__(endpoint_name, sagemaker_session, content_type='text/plain')

model = PyTorchModel(model_data=estimator.model_data,
                     role = role,
                     framework_version='0.4.0',
                     entry_point='predict.py',
                     source_dir='serve',
                     predictor_cls=StringPredictor)
predictor = model.deploy(initial_instance_count=1, instance_type='ml.m4.xlarge')
```

    Parameter image will be renamed to image_uri in SageMaker Python SDK v2.
    'create_image_uri' will be deprecated in favor of 'ImageURIProvider' class in SageMaker Python SDK v2.


    -------------!

### Testing the model

Now that we have deployed our model with the custom inference code, we should test to see if everything is working. Here we test our model by loading the first `250` positive and negative reviews and send them to the endpoint, then collect the results. The reason for only sending some of the data is that the amount of time it takes for our model to process the input and then perform inference is quite long and so testing the entire data set would be prohibitive.

```python
ground, results = test_reviews()
```

    Starting  pos  files
    Starting  neg  files



```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy_score(ground, results)
```




    0.83



As an additional test, we can try sending the `test_review` that we looked at earlier.


```python
predictor.predict(test_review)
```

    b'1'



Now that we know our endpoint is working as expected, we can set up the web page that will interact with it. 

<a id='step7'></a>

## Step 7 (again): Use the model for the web app

This entire section and the next contain tasks to complete, mostly using the AWS console.

So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.

![svg](/images/SentimentAnalysis/Web App Diagram.svg)

The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.

In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.

Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.

### Setting up a Lambda function

#### Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function

#### Part B: Create a Lambda function

```python
# We need to use the low-level library to interact with SageMaker since the SageMaker API
# is not available natively through Lambda.
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):

    # The SageMaker runtime is what allows us to invoke the endpoint that we've created.
    runtime = boto3.Session().client('sagemaker-runtime')

    # Now we use the SageMaker runtime to invoke our endpoint, sending the review we were given
    response = runtime.invoke_endpoint(EndpointName = '**ENDPOINT NAME HERE**',    # The name of the endpoint we created
                                       ContentType = 'text/plain',                 # The data format that is expected
                                       Body = event['body'])                       # The actual review

    # The response is an HTTP response whose body contains the result of our inference
    result = response['Body'].read().decode('utf-8')

    return {
        'statusCode' : 200,
        'headers' : { 'Content-Type' : 'text/plain', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' : '*' },
        'body' : result
    }
```


```python
predictor.endpoint
```

    'sagemaker-pytorch-2021-07-08-00-33-55-659'


## Step 4: Deploying our web app
