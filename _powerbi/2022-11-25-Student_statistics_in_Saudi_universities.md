The purpose of this study is to analyze the enrollment trends and popular majors in Saudi public universities and determine the market share of governmental and private higher education institutions during this period. The study will use data on the number of new students, enrolled students, and graduates in public universities, classified according to various factors such as student type, study stage, type of educational institution, administrative region, educational entity, field of study, school system, gender, and nationality.
