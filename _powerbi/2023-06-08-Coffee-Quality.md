This dashboard provides insights into coffee quality data. It gives an overview of key metrics like acidity, density, body, 
and flavor ratings to evaluate the overall quality of the coffee. Moreover, the different coffee types and regions identify 
opportunities to improve specific coffee varieties and growing locations. The visuals on the dashboard allow both production 
managers and quality inspectors to detect issues, find correlations, and spot trends in coffee quality over time so they can 
take corrective actions to ensure optimal coffee is produced and roasted.
